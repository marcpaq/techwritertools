Command line tools for technical writers.

The tedious part of a tech writer's job is repeating. They copy and
paste the same text to re-format it, they repeat file copying and
deleting to produce final files, they repeat other tasks that arenâ€™t
actually writing content.

Here's a set of tools for technical writers to automate the tedious
parts of their job so they can focus on the fun parts.

It runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
